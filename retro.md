# Retro

## What we learned
1. Hammer out the game loop/engine early
2. Make sure the build system is locked in early on

## What worked
1. Expirimentation lead to some emergent design
2. Turns out, when you don't know how to do something you can just learn it and it's fun!
3. Not spending too much time on levels early was good, because we saved a bunch of time that would have been spent refactoring
4. Doing a simplified art style was great
5. Easing and gamefeel details went a LONG way

## How to improve
1. Longer design discussion at the start
2. Set aside time at the end for polish+tweaking
